# FlashVideo
a demo to use ffmpeg, opengl es, opensl es to play music, video on Android
it is a repository to record the process of studying media group on Android for me

# Function Preview
by now, this demo repository supports a simple music player, it uses ffmpeg to decode the music source into pcm data, 
and support fundamental operations like play, pause, seek and stop;
the music is played by opensl, and it also uses soundtouch to adjust pitch and tempo which may be funny functions.

# PS
i will continue to build this repository, the next step is to use ffmpeg to play video.
hope i could receive great suggesstions from you!
