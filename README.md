# FlashVideo
a demo to use ffmpeg, opengl es, opensl es to play music, video on Android.
it is a repository to record the process of studying media group on Android for me.

# Function Preview
by now, this demo repository supports fllowing functions:
<br>1. it uses ffmpeg to decode the music source into pcm data, and support fundamental operations like play, pause, seek and stop;
<br>the music is played by opensl, and it also uses soundtouch to adjust pitch and tempo which may be funny functions.
<br>2. it uses ffmpeg, opensl and opengl es to play video, and supports normal functions like pause, resume and seek.
<br>3. it uses camera2 to show camera preview, add filters to make some magic effect, and uses a single egl environment to record the preview with filters to save it as a mp4;

# PS
i will continue to build this repository, the next step is to use ffmpeg to play video.
hope i could receive great suggesstions from you!
